## ⚠️ Project Status: Research & Development (R&D)

This project is currently in **active research and development phase**.

### Important Notes:
- 🧪 **Experimental code** - Not production ready
- 📉 **Excluded from test coverage** - Many components are prototypes
- 🔬 **R&D focus** - Exploring algorithms and data structures
- 🚧 **Code quality varies** - Contains experimental/unpolished implementations
- ⚡ **Performance over correctness** in some modules (temporary)

### What this means:
- APIs may change without notice
- Some code paths are untested or partially implemented
- Not suitable for production use
- Documentation may be incomplete

### Development Branches:
- `master` - Current R&D state (may contain unstable code)
- `gin/*` - Feature branches with cutting-edge (risky) changes
